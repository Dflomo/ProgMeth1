# Programming Methodology

A few of my assignments from the semester. Just a representation 
of the learning done in an academic setting. The class was 
challenging at times, but overall very acheivable.

Topics Ranged from; stream variables and how to use files, 
abstract functions and inheritance (in a game setting),
templating, and data structures such as queues and binary trees.
